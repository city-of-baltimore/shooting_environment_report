Greetings,<br><br>

The attached report identifies all currently open service requests within a 500 ft. radius of recent homicides and shootings in Baltimore. The following agencies may have open service requests identified in this report:<br>

<ul>
  <li>DOT</li>
  <li>DPW</li>
  <li>DHCD</li>
  <li>BGE</li>
  <li>BCRP</li>
  <li>Liquor Board</li>
</ul>

<b>Environmental issues are a critical public safety concern.</b> Addressing these issues in areas of recent violence can help stabilize the area and prevent repeat events in the vicinity.<br><br>

<b>Note to BPD</b>Police are encouraged to use their department email (@baltimorepolice.org) when submitting 311 service requests. This can be used to identify priority service requests. A field has been added to the service request in the last table of the report to indicate whether the service request was initiated with an @baltimorepolice.org email address.<br><br>

This report is now run every Wednesday at 9am (previously Tuesday at 4pm). <i>The report now uses internal data sources as opposed to Open Baltimore.</i> This will ensure more timely information.<br><br>

Thank you in advance for your attention.<br><br>

Please contact <a href='mailto:april.welch@baltimorecity'>April Welch</a> in the Mayor's Office of Performance and Innovation for questions regarding this report.<br><br><br>
